If you wish to run the python script (pyGUI.py) instead of the executable (pyGUI.exe), you must download python. 

To do this, go to pthon.org --> download --> (choose your OS) --> (windows)- Download Windows x86 executable installer; (macOS)- Download MacOS 64-bit installer

After downloading the installer, run it and make sure to click *Add Python to Path* at the bottom of the window

Now, you should be able to download pyGUI.py to your desktop and double click to run.
